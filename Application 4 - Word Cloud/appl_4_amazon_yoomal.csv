This antenna wire is longer and less expensive ($3.52 as of 8/15) than others sold here.  The wire IS thin compared to that attached to a TP-Link 9dB antenna I have but I don't know if the thinness makes much difference other than wire strength.  On the other hand, the wire is not unusually thinner than antenna wires attached to other network devices I have.<br /><br />--I think that RP-SMA-to-Cable TV Cable adapters exist.  Perhaps an antenna wire made with TV cable and a couple of those adapters would make an even better and less-expensive antenna wire -- But then maybe this thinner wire is a more efficient conductor of captured radio signals ??",2015-08-30

Honestly people, you should be running a 1-10 ft max to your antenna, with anything longer you are going to be losing too much signal. Search for Rg-174 attenuation... look at the 2.4ghz attenuation and it will be 75db LOSS at 100ft, thats 1.3db loss per foot. Lesson learned here. If you are looking for better reception of your wireless router, use one of the simple DIY aluminum parabolic reflectors on one of your antennas directly at your router -- thats what i did to remedy my router issue.  The one star was because this cable will do nothing for you at 2.4ghz, it is a pure waste of money, anyone saying they got better reception is full of crap.

It's nicely constructed and appears to use quality materials.<br /><br />I know that antenna cables are subject to signal loss in correlation to their length, and some of the $25+ cables are described as \\""low loss\\"" cables, and some define the amount of loss to expect.  Many cables indicate a loss range of .7 or greater dB per meter of length, so you want to use the shortest cable possible.<br /><br />I tested the wifi signal strength of this 5 meter extension cable (before and after installation) using inSSIDer Wifi Analyzer software on my Windows 7 desktop.  The extension cable was connected to a [[ASIN:B0007XXU3E D-Link  ANT24-0700 2.4 GHz Omni-Directional 7 dBi Indoor Antenna]].  The drop in signal was about 5dB using the cable, and the gain from moving the D-Link Antenna to a better location in the room using the extension cable was about 5dB.  So, for me, there was not a benefit when connected to the D-Link ANT24-0700.<br /><br />Then, I connected it to one of the three 'standard' 4\\"" antenna that came with my wireless adapter card ([[ASIN:B000N4WRFY D-Link DWA-556 Xtreme N PCI Express Desktop Adapter]]).  By moving one of the three 'standard' 4\\"" connectors to a better location using this 5 meter extension cable, I was able to gain about 3 dB.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you use a Wifi Analyzer on your cell phone (such as Wifi Analyzer by farproc for Android) to first test various locations that are within 5 meters of your current antenna's location.  If you can pick up more than 5 dB of gain in a better location, this 5 meter extension cable may be a worthwhile option.
