AT FIRST,"This is the second speaker I've purchased and once again I'm having the same issue as before. After a couple months of usage and charging, the charging piece on the device starts to loosen, eventually breaking within the device completely and not allowing for it to work anymore... I originally thought it was me, but now that I need to trash my second Philips in a year, I think its time to move on to another speaker brand.<br /><br />As for sound quality and overall product, I really enjoyed using this portable speaker. Better deal than most out there, but not worth it if I need to buy one every 5 months.",2015-08-23

US,38353526,R2774DF8LBRK7Z,B00J3O9DYI,766372886,Philips Wireless Portable Speaker,Electronics,5,1,2,N,Y,Surprisingly big sound with rich base from such a portable device.,"My primary reason for buying BT3500B/37 was the need for an above average portable Bluetooth speaker that could be used in conjunction with my iPhone or iPad. It had to be battery-operated, rechargeable and stereo sound -capable. I often listen to International radio broadcasts or watch online TV. I also stream music from my home media center.<br /><br />Prior to this purchase, I had tested quite a few mono speakers at a local brick and mortar store ( a well known national chain). Mono units typically produce a smaller, flatter sound, and I could not make myself sacrifice good sound quality for the size. Stereo units looked like the right way to go, but many lacked in quality. Sure, there are a lot of speakers out there that will easily break your bank, and they may be worth the expense and all... Personaly, I needed something on a reasonably priced without sacrificing quality. I need to add that I already own a couple of older non-Bluetooth speakers and iPod docks by Philps and Logitech. They produce much richer, fuller sound compared to BT3500B/37.  However, they are stationary and could not be operated without AC power.<br /><br />Regardless of its size or purpose, this Bluetooth speaker puts out a nice, round sound with decent highs and lows. base. You will appreciate the sound quality the most when using the speaker in a smaller room, such as a typical bedroom or a bathroom. It is loud enough when used outside, but you're going to lose some of the lows. The smartest thing about this speaker is that it can adjust its volume automatically when turned up too high to minimize and eliminate sound distortion.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.",2015-07-07

I bought this for outdoor movies because my projector's speaker is awful. Once I figured out how to route the sound manually to the speaker so it wasn't going through the HDMI to the projector's speaker, I was blown away by the difference. Nice and loud...absolutely no trouble hearing clearly outside...in fact, my neighbor four doors down said he could hear it! If you're using a computer, check the device properties. There are settings for virtual surround, etc. that can improve sound quality even more.<br /><br />I easily paired this with my laptop and my cell phone and it appears that it can switch back and forth between devices on its own if it's paired with more than one &#34;active&#34; device. Pretty cool. Once it's paired the first time, pairing it again is just a matter of switching it to the Bluetooth setting and pressing the pairing button. Couldn't be easier.<br /><br />It seems to hold its charge for a good period as well. I had it running continuously on full volume for about 2.5 hours and didn't run out of juice.

I was looking at the more expensive ones around $150+ for awhile and the more I read about them the more it seemed like the extra $70-80 just wasn't worth it.

I was undecided between this model and the bigger model (which costs 20 dollars more), but chose this model due to its having microphone.  I got tired of carrying a portable boombox around for my wife's dance group practice, as well as their stack of CDs.  Got this 2 days ago and already put it to good use.  Now anyone in her dance group can link to it from their phone, and they can even play music directly from youtube, which relieves me from having to manage their dance music CD collection.<br /><br />The sound is loud enough and does not sound bad at all.  I'm a live-sound engineer & musician who deals with powered PA speakers every weekend, and this doesn't sound bad at all for its size.  I love the volume dial as it can be cranked up/down quickly unlike the + - buttons on most electronics nowaday.  Build quality seems to be quite good, too.<br /><br />I used the unit as a speaker phone today while on a conference.  Not sure how it sounds to the other parties, but did not hear anyone complain. I'm glad I picked this model for the mic, and I'm sure I will be using it as speaker phone a lot more in the future.<br /><br />The only thing I think it needs is to be weatherproof.  But then, it's not a big deal.  It's easy to hold as it's about the right thickness for the palm, it does feel substantial when I hold it in my hand.  There is a fold-able built-in stand in the back side that can prop the unit up at about 30-degree and 45-degree angles (could have been better if it can accommodate 60-degree angle).<br /><br />I haven't looked into how to replace the rechargeable battery, or how much the battery costs yet.

So this was not an isolated incident with regards to my daughters speaker.  So I would like to recommend that you not purchase this speaker until Philips comes out with a better version.

For one thing the controls seem designed to appeal to an older crowd.  I remember when Neil Armstrong took that one small step for mankind on the moon, and I've just never been happy with all these push buttons that serve two or three different purposes.  I tried an Oontz speaker and couldn't get it to work.  I'm not going to use my speaker for music, so I do not want track forward and track backward buttons, especially if I'm going to confuse them for volume up or volume down, which was the case with the Oontz.  On this speaker the volume control is a large silver knob, which works great.  Thank you, Philips!  Better yet, the other major control is a little slided that has three positions: Off, Bluetooth, and Aux In.  Slide it to BT and a little light glows blue.  Slide it to Aux In and the light glows red.  Turn it off and the light doesn't glow unless the unit is charging, in which case it glows red.  The upshot is that it's really easy to know which function you've got.  Just look at the light.  I love the controls on this speaker.  They're absolutely perfect.  The only slight hitch is in the button that enables the unit to pair.  This button also answers the phone, and it's smaller and not as easy to find as I would like, but after fumbling around with the Oontz and getting everything wrong all the time I can live with that one button serving dual purposes.  This unit is slightly larger than I expected, but it's slim and has rounded corners and seems designed to slide into a business case. Nothing will fall off or get broken.  I looked at the Solemate, but I thought it would be a lot bulkier than I wanted.  It's thick and wouldn't be as easy to set on a nightstand, for example.  Now for news that I think will either sell this speaker or cause you to look elsewhere: if you're in a conference room with clients and everybody is wearing their best ties and talking money, if you pull this speaker out of your bag and set it on the table to used as a speakerphone or provide audio for a screen presentation, nobody is going to think you borrowed it from your teenager. It looks very professional.  The speakerphone function works find, and it gets loud enough to work in a decent-sized conference room.  It also pairs easily, and when it pairs it makes a small audio tone that wouldn't sound out of place in a business setting.  I bought this speaker specifically to provide audio for my iPad or iPhone when I travel and I want to stream a movie on Instant Video.  So far when I have to make business presentations I've never had to provide the projector--I have one, just in case--and I never have audio.  However, if that ever changes I already have the speaker I need.<br /><br />Now for the sound.  If you're wanting to provide the jams for your next block party, I would recommend looking elsewhere. This speaker does not have a bass port, and it derives all of its sound from two small drivers.  I don't consider myself an audiophile, but when I listen to music I like to hear crystal clear highs and a good low end.  I also like a nice sound stage.  This speaker does not excel in any of those areas.  It's not that it sounds awful, but realistically speaking no speaker this small is going to create the rich, full sound you expect from full-size speakers. Of course I'm also not impressed with the JBL Flip 2, the JBL Charge, the UE Boom, or the Bose Soundlink Mini, all of which I auditioned and rejected, mainly because I didn't like the way any of them sounded.  There's no soundstage at all in any of those speakers, and none of them have good highs.  Once I lowered my expectations for the sound, I concentrated more on the controls--and this speaker came out on top.  For movies and as a speakerphone it will work fine.  I also plan to useit paired with my iPhone when I'm using it as a GPS, and I expect it will work out well for that purpose as well.  Your mileage may vary, but that's my take on this Philips speaker.  I'm giving it four stars because I like it a lot.  If it sounded a little nicer and the button to answer the phone were larger and easier to find I'd give it a fifth star.<br /><br />Update 9/7/2014 -- I've been using this speaker quite a bit to provide audio for TV shows and movies, and it performs great. The battery life and sound are both very good.  Last night I watched Star Wars--just Star Wars--which of course has a lot of thundering music and good sound effects.  The movie sounded fine, and I even noticed that some of the sound effects sounded quite \\""directional\\"".  An enemy fighter would zoom across the screen, and it sounded like it was moving from left to right.  From a speaker this small that's more than I could ask, to be honest. This is a good speaker.",2014-07-19

I liked this better than the $200 Bose wireless mini speaker!,"I didn't buy this through Amazon, so this review won't be a verified purchase.  I purchased this in the wee hours of this morning at a 24 hour Walmart after I spent a couple of hours earlier this evening listening to the demo speakers at my local Best Buy.  Seriously...THIS speaker to me sounds BETTER than the $200 JBL cylinder speaker I was listening to at Best Buy earlier tonight and better than the $200 Beats speaker AND better than the $200 mini Bose wireless speaker!  It has just the perfect mix of base with the higher end sounds.  I'm not a technical expert but I can tell you what I like and I like this sound!  And the price was just under $70.  I LOVE Amazon, but for a purchase like this, I wanted to hear the sound without having to purchase then possibly send it back.  If you don't have a local Walmart or if the price drops here on Amazon, buy it through Amazon, you won't be disappointed.  And the great thing is I have this speaker now linked to my iphone5 for all my great Amazon Prime music I now have and it's linked to my Dell laptop for all my itunes music.  My ONLY disappointment was the instructions weren't great.  It's one of those fold out papers that has a lot of photos instead of step by step written instructions.  The written instructions are there alongside the photos, but the instructions aren't even numbered.  But hey, it's really not a lot to setting it up.  I had the most trouble getting the settings right on my Dell laptop to be able to recognize this cool speaker, so that wasn't the speaker's problem.  Highly recommend!!!",2014-07-06

I want to listen to my podcasts and music in my car without installing expensive and non-transportable systems.  My previous solution was battery powered and would get inaudible after a few days on batteries and I had to plug in a standard phone plug.  totally unacceptable and unbearable.  With this device I get in my car, turn on my iPod and turn on the BT.  They immediately link and I just hit play.  No wires to plug in; magnificent sound with more than enough volume control.  When I get home I just put it on the charger and have never experienced lack of power through many hours of use.  I use it in the house and on the deck.  I had it in my motorcycle saddlebag at an award picnic and they incredibly had no music!  I took it out and set my iPod to an acceptable playlist, cranked it up and it played great tunes that were audible throughout the area and everybody raved at this little powerhouse.  A guy requested a particular song.  I linked it to my Nokia phone, found the song on Youtube and within a minute of his request the song was playing for all to hear!  It blew his mind!  I love this product.  It was simplicity itself to set up with my Bluetooth devices and has answered all my portable listening requirements.",2014-06-28
