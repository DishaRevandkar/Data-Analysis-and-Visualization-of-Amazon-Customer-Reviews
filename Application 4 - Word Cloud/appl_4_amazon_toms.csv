US,11057113,R19BXA1CURU36L,B000XRB41E,532718381,TOMS Women's Classics Flat,Shoes,5,0,0,N,Y,So Comfortable!,I have narrow feet and wear a size 5M.  TOMS fit a little bit closer to the feet and aren't as wide as their competitor BOBS.  The leather foot bed soaks up moisture and wicks it away.  There is a bit of an arch support so they are good to walk in.  I actually walked all over Vegas with these shoes.  I've had them for about 9 months now they have held up pretty well.  I have not washed them yet (I only wear them in the summer months) so I'm not sure how it's going to do in the washing machine.,2014-02-09
